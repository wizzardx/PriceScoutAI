# 🏷️ PriceScoutAI: A Work-in-Progress AI-Powered Price Comparison Tool

🚀 **🚧 This project is in early development.**
Currently focused on AI-driven retailer discovery & structured price validation.
*Real-time price fetching & API integration are planned for future updates.*

---

## 📌 Overview
PriceScoutAI is an **AI-powered price comparison tool** that aims to scrape product prices across multiple retailers, compare them across currencies, and return the lowest available price. This will be useful for **finding the best deals**, monitoring price trends, and optimizing purchases.

🔹 **AI-Powered Retailer Matching** *(Currently implemented)* - Identifies retailers based on search queries.
🔹 **Multi-Retailer & Multi-Currency Support** *(Planned)* - Will convert prices across platforms.
🔹 **Web Scraping for Real-Time Price Updates** *(Upcoming)* - Future versions will support live price retrieval.
🔹 **TDD-Driven Development** *(Ongoing)* - Test-driven approach for reliability.

## 📊 Example Use Case *(Planned Feature)*
🚧 *Example queries are currently conceptual—price fetching is under development!*

```python
from pricescoutai import find_best_prices

query = "MacBook Pro 14-inch M3"
best_prices = find_best_prices(query)
print(best_prices)
```

✅ **Expected Output:** *(Future Implementation Goal)*
```json
{
  "Amazon": "$1,899",
  "BestBuy": "$1,849",
  "Walmart": "$1,879",
  "Newegg": "$1,869",
  "Cheapest": "BestBuy ($1,849)"
}
```
